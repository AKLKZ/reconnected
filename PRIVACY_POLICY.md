# Reconnected: Privacy policy
**Welcome to Reconnected app for Android!**

This is an open source Android app developed by Aleix Soler. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license; the app is also available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information, for that reason no information is collected.

The only service that gets data from user is the one in charged of checking if signal is available, but none of this information is saved locally or remotely, it's just processed.
